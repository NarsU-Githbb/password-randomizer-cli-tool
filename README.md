Trying to make something with go(lang) for first time.

Hoping to make a cli tool that randomizes a strong password that includes:
a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, symbols & is at least 12 characters long.

Hoping that making this project would give me a better understanding on the basics of Go as well as train me for
a coding sprint that I'll be participating in the near future.
